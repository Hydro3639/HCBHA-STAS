* HCBHA stands for the Hierachical Clustering Based Hybrid Assembly, which could be applied for high-quality and high-contiguity genome reconstruction <br>
from the high-complexity systems by using iterative hybrid assembly, bining and reads mapping. The genome reconstruction methods require both the short <br>
reads and long reads from the same sample.

For instructions, usage and explanations, please see the HCBHA wiki!
