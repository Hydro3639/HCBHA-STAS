HCBHA stands for the Hierachical Clustering Based Hybrid Assembly, which could be applied for high-quality and high-contiguity genome reconstructionfrom the high-complexity systems by using iterative hybrid assembly, bining and reads mapping. The genome reconstruction methods require both the short reads and long reads from the same sample.

For instructions, usage and explanations, please see the HCBHA wiki!
